I'm excited to introduce **PEST.js** - a feature-based Express.js boilerplate designed to streamline backend development while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

<Note type="success">
  PEST.js combines the simplicity of Express.js with enterprise-grade features, robust security, and modern development practices - all preconfigured and ready to use.
</Note>

## Why PEST.js?

While Express.js provides an excellent foundation, setting up a production-ready application often requires significant configuration and boilerplate code. PEST.js provides a well-structured starting point with essential features pre-configured.

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Feature-Based Architecture">
    A modular structure that organizes code by features rather than technical layers, making it easier to:
    - Scale applications
    - Maintain code
    - Add new features
    - Work in teams
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Enterprise Security">
    Pre-configured security features including:
    - Helmet for HTTP headers
    - CORS configuration
    - Rate limiting
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Developer Experience">
    Ready-to-use development setup with:
    - TypeScript configuration
    - Development server with hot reload
    - API documentation setup
    - Testing configuration
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Key Features

<Files items={[
  {
    type: "folder",
    name: "Features",
    isOpen: true,
    indicator: "add",
    children: [
      { 
        type: "folder", 
        name: "Core", 
        indicator: "add",
        children: [
          { type: "file", name: "TypeScript Setup", indicator: "add" },
          { type: "file", name: "Express.js Configuration", indicator: "add" },
          { type: "file", name: "MongoDB Setup", indicator: "add" }
        ]
      },
      { 
        type: "folder", 
        name: "Security",

          { type: "file", name: "Authentication Boilerplate", indicator: "add" }
        ]
      },
      { 
        type: "folder", 
        name: "DevOps", 
        indicator: "add",
        children: [
          { type: "file", name: "Dockerfile", indicator: "add" },
          { type: "file", name: "Docker Compose", indicator: "add" }
        ]

## Project Structure

PEST.js follows a feature-based architecture that keeps your code organized and maintainable:

```typescript
src/
  ├── features/          # Feature modules
  │   ├── auth/         # Authentication feature
  │   └── users/        # User management
  ├── middleware/       # Custom middleware
  ├── utils/           # Utility functions
  ├── config/          # Configuration files
  └── app.ts           # Application entry point
```

## Use Cases

This template is ideal for:

- **REST APIs**: Robust routing and middleware system
- **Backend Services**: Security and scalability features
- **MVP Projects**: Quick setup and development workflow
- **Learning Projects**: Well-structured Express.js example

## Performance Considerations

<Note type="warning">
The template includes best practices for:

- Efficient routing setup
- Database connection management
