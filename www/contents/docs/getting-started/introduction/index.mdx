description: A feature-based Express.js and TypeScript based template engine
---
## What is PEST.js?  

PEST.js is a feature-rich Express.js template engine designed to simplify and enhance backend development. It provides a structured, scalable foundation for building production-ready Node.js applications while abstracting essential configurations such as middleware, security, and logging.  

PEST.js is built on top of Express.js, offering additional optimizations while maintaining flexibility. It enables developers to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate configurations.  

## Why Use PEST.js?  

PEST.js offers several advantages over a standard Express.js setup:  

- **Feature-Based Structure** – Encourages modular development with separate controllers, services, and models.  
- **Pre-Configured Security** – Includes industry-standard security practices such as Helmet, CORS, and rate limiting.  
- **Built-In Type Safety** – Fully supports TypeScript for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.  
- **Automated API Documentation** – Generates OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints.  
- **Production-Ready Logging & Monitoring** – Uses Winston for structured logging and error handling.  
- **Scalability** – Designed to scale from small applications to enterprise-level systems.  

## Key Features  

PEST.js includes the following built-in features:  

- **Express.js Foundation** – Standard Express.js setup with additional enhancements.  
- **TypeScript-First** – Provides strong type safety across the entire project.  
- **Modular Architecture** – Feature-based folder structure for better organization.  
- **Security Best Practices** – Built-in middleware for authentication, rate limiting, and input validation.  
- **Integrated Database Support** – Uses Mongoose for MongoDB integration with structured schemas.  
- **Middleware Support** – Includes common middleware for request validation, authentication, and logging.  
- **Automated Testing** – Pre-configured with Jest and Supertest for unit and integration testing.  
- **Containerization** – Docker-ready setup for deployment in cloud environments.  

## Who Should Use PEST.js?  

- **Developers building RESTful APIs with Express.js**  
- **Teams that need a scalable, maintainable project structure**  
- **Projects that require security best practices out of the box**  
- **Applications that benefit from TypeScript’s type safety**  
- **Enterprise applications that require structured logging and error handling**
