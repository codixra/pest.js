<Note type="success">
  PEST.js is built on core principles that ensure scalability, maintainability, and security for backend applications.
</Note>

## Core Principles

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Modularity">
    PEST.js follows a **feature-based modular structure**, separating concerns into well-defined components:
    
    <Files items={[
      {
        type: "folder",
        name: "features",
        isOpen: true,
        indicator: "add",
        children: [
          { type: "folder", name: "controllers", indicator: "add" },
          { type: "folder", name: "services", indicator: "add" },
          { type: "folder", name: "models", indicator: "add" }
        ]
      }
    ]} />
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Type Safety">
    With a **TypeScript-first approach**, PEST.js leverages strong typing for:
    - Better code quality
    - Fewer runtime errors
    - Enhanced developer experience
    - Improved maintainability
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Security by Default">
    <Note type="warning">
      Security is a top priority. PEST.js includes:
      - Helmet for HTTP headers
      - CORS configuration
      - Rate limiting
      - Input validation using Zod
    </Note>
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Scalability">
    Designed to scale from **small projects to large enterprise applications** with:
    - Modular architecture
    - Efficient routing
    - Database optimization
    - Caching support
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Production Readiness

<Files items={[
  {
    type: "folder",
    name: "Production Features",
    isOpen: true,
    indicator: "add",
    children: [
      { type: "file", name: "Structured Logging", indicator: "add" },
      { type: "file", name: "Error Handling", indicator: "add" },
      { type: "file", name: "Monitoring", indicator: "add" },
      { type: "file", name: "Docker Support", indicator: "add" }
    ]
  }
]} />
